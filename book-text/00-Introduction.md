# Introduction

In late spring 2018, my manager presented me with intriguing news. Our executive director had noticed that while Angular was widely used across his organization, the in-house developers lacked extensive experience with it.

They pondered various methods to address this gap, ranging from subscribing to video courses, purchasing books, or hiring an external training firm to conduct the required training.

My manager then suggested, "What if we ask Mike Callaghan to handle it?" Thus, in an executive meeting, he proposed that I be the one to train our software developers on Angular.

## My Angular Journey

My engagement with Angular dates back to AngularJS 1.2. My debut Angular application was a mobile swimming coach, crafted with the Ionic Framework and AngularJS.

Presently, I almost exclusively create web applications using Angular. Though I confess, I have briefly experimented with React - even going as far as writing a book on using React with Ionic.

Whenever I embark on a new application, whether for personal or professional use, I usually begin with Angular.

## What's in this Book?

This book is a compilation of essays that I've written for diverse technical audiences over the past year or so. These pieces directly or indirectly pertain to Angular development.

However, this book is not intended for beginners in web development - there are ample resources catering to that audience. Instead, this book is aimed at seasoned web developers who have some experience or familiarity with Angular.

The content, admittedly, bears my biases, much like the broader Angular ecosystem.

I illustrate solutions that have proven effective for me and my team. Other approaches and solutions may also yield results, but I won't focus on them here.

The contents of this book reflect my experience, and I hope they offer valuable insights for your learning journey.
