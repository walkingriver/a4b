<h1 id="how-we-learn">How We Learn</h1>
<p>Have you ever stopped to think about how we learn things? I was
recently reflecting on when my 15-year old was learning to drive. I had
the unenviable job of teaching him. At the time, it struck me that he
had to think about every little detail of what he was doing. He needed
to be reminded to check his mirrors, signal his lane changes, look
behind him when backing up, etc.. Learning to drive requires absolute
and complete attention. He didn’t even have the spare mental capacity to
listen to music.</p>
<p>Watching him struggle reminded me of something I learned many years
ago about how we learn new things. Regardless of what we are learning –
whether it’s driving, putting up drywall, or learning a new programming
language – we all go through four stages of learning. You could think of
them as the four steps of mastery. They are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unconscious incompetence: You don’t know what you don’t know</li>
<li>Conscious incompetence: You understand what you don’t know and want
to learn</li>
<li>Conscious competence: You start to understand, with effort</li>
<li>Unconscious competence: You internalize your understanding and no
longer have to thing about it. You just “get it.”</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="learning-to-drive">Learning to Drive</h2>
<p>In my son’s case, step 1 occurred when he realized he wanted to
drive, but had no idea what that entails. This is the stage where every
little detail needs to be explained. Progress is slow, but as long as he
has enthusiasm for the subject, we move forward.</p>
<h2 id="learning-mobile-app-development">Learning Mobile App
Development</h2>
<p>Likewise, you may decide that you want to learn mobile app
development, but don’t know where to begin. This is Step 1, Unconscious
Incompetence. You may not even know what technologies are available to
help you. But you’re excited about a new idea you had that will change
the world.</p>
<p>So you do some research, read some online blogs, talk to friends and
colleagues, and perhaps pick a place to start. You understand pretty
well that there is much you still have to learn. You at least know what
you don’t know, and have now reached Step 2, or Conscious Incompetence.
This is the prime learning stage. You read more specific articles, maybe
take some classes, or watch training videos.</p>
<h2 id="applying-knowledge-to-practice">Applying Knowledge to
Practice</h2>
<p>If you’re like most people, this isn’t quite enough. You have begun
to understand the material on an intellectual level. Now you need to
practice, apply what you’ve learned. After doing this awhile, you
finally reach Step 3, or Conscious Competence. Your skills are
improving, but you aren’t completely comfortable yet. This is the time
when you slowly become accustomed to the new skill, but still
occasionally need to appeal to your local experts, refer to reference
material, or post to Stack Overflow.</p>
<h2 id="mastery">Mastery</h2>
<p>As you continue to practice and apply your knowledge, eventually
you’ll discover that you no longer need to look up the syntax of an
obscure feature or the parameters of troublesome functions. You may also
realize that you are answering more questions than you’re asking.
Congratulations. You’ve reached Step 4, Unconscious Competence, the
ultimate pinnacle of mastery.</p>
<p>Depending on the subject, you may be satisfied to stop at step 3. It
may not be possible to go further. That’s OK. It isn’t necessary or even
desirable to master every subject or every skill.</p>
<h2 id="time-and-learning">Time and Learning</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that I haven’t said anything about the time this
takes. That depends on many factors: your personal or professional
interest the subject, the time you have to spend on this compared to
other demands, or how well you have learned to learn. That’s right, you
go through these same steps even when learning to learn.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>What should you take away from this? Keep these steps in mind the
next time you start to learn a new skill. And in the meantime, practice
your learning. Pick a topic. Study it. Pay attention to the steps you go
through.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, I discuss how these same steps can apply from a
different perspective: that of a teacher. I will show how the teacher’s
approach has to change, according to which step the student is on.</p>
