<h1 id="slow-down-to-be-noticed">Slow Down to Be Noticed</h1>
<p>If you want to have a more positive impact on those around you in
your daily life, personal or professional, I have two words of advice:
slow down. I will explain the details and benefits in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I get asked from time to time what kinds of advice I have for people
looking to get ahead, be taken seriously, or just be thought of more
positively. After an experience I had with some young men at church, one
of my favorite suggestions is to recommend they try slowing down their
speech.</p>
<p>Though the events below happened in a religious setting, the
principles I will describe apply equally in personal, academic, and
professional settings. Allow me to set the stage.</p>
<p>I was facilitating a Sunday meeting at church with some of our older
teenagers. We were taking turns reading scripture and it seemed that
everyone, myself included, was simply going through the motions. We
heard the words, but there was little meaning being conveyed.</p>
<h2 id="an-idea-took-shape">An Idea Took Shape</h2>
<p>I stopped everyone and suggested that we start over, but this time
with a twist. I chose one of the young men and asked him to read a
somewhat lengthy verse in his normal cadence, while I timed him. I asked
the rest of them to close their eyes and just listen. His time, as I
recall, was somewhere around 25 seconds.</p>
<p>Then I asked him to read the same verse again, but this time as
slowly as he could without feeling uncomfortable. I asked the others to
close their eyes and listen once more, and again I timed him. It was
less than 35 seconds. Longer, but not dramatically so.</p>
<p>The result, however, was very dramatic. The mood in the room changed.
Everyone sat still, absorbing a scripture passage they had now heard
three times. It seemed to take on an entirely new meaning.</p>
<p>In fact, it was close to magic.</p>
<p>The boys then took turns with this experiment. Though each read and
spoke much more slowly than normal, none sounded unnatural or forced.
Their words were clear and distinct, each syllable perfectly
enunciated.</p>
<p>By the end of the experiment, each was convinced that there was
something to this. I challenged them to try to apply this in their
everyday lives. In school, read more slowly and with greater intent.
Also try to speak more slowly and clearly. I promised them that if they
made a conscious effort, then they would see positive results. They
accepted.</p>
<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p>Reading about this experience will only provide you with half of the
story. I want you to understand what I am telling you at a deeper
level.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, I recorded myself reading the Preamble to the US
Constitution (See Figure 23.1) three different ways. I assure that
throughout the recordings, I have not used any editing to speed up or
slow down the content.</p>

YouTube with this link: <a

<h3 id="normal">Normal</h3>
<p>At first, I simply read the words at a comfortable pace, without
trying to go slower or faster than I normally would. It took me just
about 19 seconds to read at this pace. I believe it is
understandable.</p>
<h3 id="fast">Fast</h3>
<p>On this pass I read the passage as fast I could without the words
becoming garbled and meaningless. This took about 12 seconds to get
through it. Though the words are reasonably clear, it strikes me that
the overall message is lost.</p>
<h3 id="slow">Slow</h3>
<p>The final reading is my attempt to go as slow as I comfortably could,
paying attention to each word, and speaking as clearly as possible. I
timed this at 24 seconds. To me, it does not sound forced or
intentionally prolonged. It sounded worse in my head while I was reading
it than it sounds to me now.</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>What do you think? Can you hear, and possibly even feel, the
difference? I hope you agree that the final reading is the most
impactful and imparts the greatest meaning to the listener.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-apply-this">How You Can Apply This</h2>
<p>My reason for telling you this story is to convince you to apply it
in your own life, both personal and professional.</p>
<p>Most of the people I work with tend to speak too quickly and too
loudly, myself included. Whether you are reading or speaking,
intentionally slow yourself down. Hear each word as you speak it. Pay
particular attention to enunciating the consonants. If you can do so
naturally, try to use fewer contractions. Say “cannot” and “will not”
instead of “can’t” and “won’t.” And please, try never to use the word
“could’ve.” It too often comes out sounding like “could of,” which is
not even a proper phrase.</p>
<p>Speaking more slowly has the additional effect of causing us to speak
more softly. I do not quite understand why this is, but it seems
universal.</p>
<p>If you decide to try it yourself, I predict that you will experience
some benefits almost immediately.</p>
<h3 id="people-will-listen">People Will Listen</h3>
<p>When you speak softly, slowly, and clearly, people will pay more
attention to what you are saying. Perhaps it is counter-intuitive, but
you will be heard more the quieter you are. That does not mean to
whisper. If you find that people are asking you to repeat yourself, you
are probably speaking a bit too quietly.</p>
<h3 id="people-will-notice">People Will Notice</h3>
<p>A few weeks after my experiment with our young men, I heard from some
other members of our congregation. They reported that their interactions
with these young men had improved significantly, but they struggled to
tell me exactly why. They knew the boys were doing something
differently, but they could not say what.</p>
<p>I concluded from their comments that people will notice something has
changed for the better, but they will probably not know exactly what the
change was.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-yourself">Try It Yourself</h2>
<p>Choose a similar passage of text that is important to you and conduct
your own experiment. Read it three times, as I did above. Record
yourself and play it back. Time it. Find out how it sounds after a brief
delay to reset your brain.</p>
<p>Once you have convinced yourself that there is something to this,
apply it in your daily life. Maybe start at home, deliberately trying to
slow yourself down when you speak and read. Tell no one for at least a
week. See whether or not people begin treating you differently, maybe
with a little more respect. Report back and let me know how it goes.</p>
