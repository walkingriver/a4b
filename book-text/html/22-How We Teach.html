<h1 id="how-we-teach">How We Teach</h1>
<p>Knowing the basics of how to teach is critical on the path to
becoming an effective Angular Advocate.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, I specifically discussed the four steps that
everyone goes through when learning something new. In this chapter, I am
going to discuss how to teach students at each step of the process. The
techniques used vary, depending on where a given student is. Please
note, you don’t have to be a professional teacher to understand and use
these techniques. Whether you are a teacher, a parent, a manager, a
mentor, or even a student yourself, understanding these techniques can
make you better at what you do.</p>
<p>To recap the four stages learning, they are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unconscious incompetence: You don’t know what you don’t know</li>
<li>Conscious incompetence: You understand what you don’t know and want
to learn</li>
<li>Conscious competence: You start to understand, with effort</li>
<li>Unconscious competence: You internalize your understanding and no
longer have to thing about it. You just “get it.”</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="teaching-edge">Teaching EDGE</h2>
<p>The Boy Scouts of America is widely recognized as an organization
that is expert at teaching practical skills to millions of boys (and
now, girls), using mostly volunteers with very little training. They do
that by using the teaching methods I am going to describe here. Those
methods are wrapped in something they call EDGE.</p>
<p>EDGE is an acronym that stands for Explain, Demonstrate, Guide, and
Enable. Each of these represents a specific teaching style, applied in
order to anyone learning a new topic or skill. It’s not a coincidence
that there are four steps, and each one aligns perfectly with the four
stages of the learning process.</p>
<h3 id="explain">Explain</h3>
<p>When students are on Stage 1, Unconscious Incompetence, they don’t
know what they don’t know. It’s up to you Explain everything to them. If
the material is brand new, you cannot assume that they will have even
basic knowledge of the subject. Everything needs to be spelled out. You
should avoid acronyms and jargon, especially anything that is specific
to subject being taught. Explaining the subject moves the student closer
to Stage 2, Conscious Incompetence.</p>
<h3 id="demonstrate">Demonstrate</h3>
<p>Once the subject has been explained, and it appears that the students
understand the basics of what’s going on, you can move onto
Demonstrate.</p>
<p>Here you have the opportunity to offer a practical demonstration of
the topic, skill, or task being taught. Depending on the complexity of
the topic, more than one demonstration, along with repeating the
explanation for reinforcement, may be necessary. This is Stage 2,
Conscious Incompetence. They understand what it is they do not know.</p>
<p>Through demonstration, you provide a visual, sometimes hands-on
illustration of the idea you are trying to convey.</p>
<h3 id="guide">Guide</h3>
<p>Now it’s time to practice. With your help, the student takes a turn
exercising the skill or applying the knowledge provided. During this
phase, you will carefully Guide the student every step of the way. This
step is cyclical, and repetition will almost certainly be required.
Continue to explain as needed, and perhaps go back to demonstrating a
particular technique. With practice, the student will gradually move to
becoming Consciously Competent. The skill won’t be automatic yet, but
understanding is there.</p>
<h3 id="enable">Enable</h3>
<p>Once you feel that the student has a solid grasp of the concepts you
are teaching, it’s time to back off and give them a little space. You
gradually remove your immediate supervision, to Enable the student to
master the subject. One way to do that is to have the student informally
teach someone else the same topic or skill. Teaching others reinforces
those concepts and helps move the individual towards Unconscious
Competence.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let’s look at a real-world example of using EDGE in practice. As I
mentioned in the last chapter, I had been experiencing the delightful
process of teaching my 15-year-old son to drive. EDGE is incredibly
valuable here. During one lesson, we practiced panic braking. One
Saturday morning, we found an empty parking lot behind an office
building, and prepared for the lesson.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was Explain to him what we would be doing. We
discussed when panic braking would be necessary, and how to do it
safely, with and without anti-lock brakes. (Notice I did not assume he
knew the acronym ABS.) We talked about how to steer a car while braking,
where the driver’s attention should be focused, etc.</p>
<p>Once the Explanation was finished, I proceeded to Demonstrate the
techniques we discussed. I showed him panic braking from various speeds
from 15 to 35 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Then it was his turn. We switched places, and he practiced what I had
just demonstrated. I did not simply hand him the keys, get out of the
car, and let him drive off. Instead, I remained with him to Guide him
through the process, answering questions, gently correcting him when
necessary, and offering helpful reminders when appropriate.</p>
<p>It would be foolish to assume at this point that my son has totally
mastered this skill. I will Enable his progress by providing
opportunities for him to continue practicing and gaining confidence.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>There are some tactical challenges to be aware of. EDGE works best
when there is something tangible to demonstrate and practice. It would
be difficult to teach world history using EDGE. You would be hard
pressed to get much past Explain and Demonstrate. I am not sure how you
Guide someone through a practical history lesson. What is important is
to realize that each step in the process reinforces the previous one.
The further you and the student can go, the better.</p>
<p>Another potential challenge is that most people do not learn at
identical rates. If you find yourself teaching a group, you will quickly
discover that they will not all pick it up at the same time. You need to
be patient, often repeating steps based on where the student is. That is
why understanding the equivalence between EDGE and the steps of learning
is key.</p>
<p>A final challenge is that many students, myself included, have a hard
time picking up a new concept that has no immediate application in their
lives. In other words, some people have a hard time learning just for
the sake of learning. As a case in point, I struggled for years to learn
how to tie certain Boy Scout knots. This was particularly embarrassing
while I was serving as a scoutmaster. On one campout, however, I was
given the task of securing our flagpole to another pole. I knew I had to
lash the two poles together. I even knew that I had to use a Round
Lashing. I had simply never been able to do it. One of the scouts saved
me by teaching me, using the EDGE method, how to use the clove hitch and
round lashing to secure the two poles together. Once I had a “why,” I
was able to master the skill relatively quickly. Round lashings and
clove hitches no longer give me any trouble.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whenever you find yourself teaching someone a new topic or skill,
whether formally or informally, your student will certainly go through
the steps of the learning process. Being able to recognize which step
they are in, and to respond with the appropriate EDGE technique, will
make you a more effective teacher. Your students will learn faster and
retain the information better. With practice, you may even be able to
have your student teach the next student, which serves to reinforce the
knowledge in both the student and the teacher.</p>
