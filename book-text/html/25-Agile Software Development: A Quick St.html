Development: A Quick Start Guide</h1>
<h2
id="the-basics-of-agile-software-development-and-how-it-can-benefit-your-project">The
Basics of Agile Software Development and How it Can Benefit Your
Project</h2>
<p>A recent tweet of mine seemed to get a lot of traction, so I decided
to revisit an article from a few years ago, updated for today’s software
development needs.</p>
<p>Agile software development is a popular and effective way to build
software. It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and regular delivery
of working software. In this blog post, we’ll introduce you to the
basics of agile and explain how it can improve your team’s software
development process.</p>
<p>When starting a new software project, your team has a lot of
decisions to make. Not the least of which is how to track the features
from initial design through completion. Agile can help make the entire
process easy and painless. Let’s jump right in.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, I’m going to use Trello. If you
want to follow along, doing so with Trello will be the simplest way, but
you should be able to apply the ideas to any similar tracking
system.</p>
<h2 id="task-creation-and-tracking">Task Creation and Tracking</h2>
<p>Setup with Trello is fast. Simply go to the Trello website at
https://www.trello.com/, logon (or create an account), create an
organization for your team, add members, and set up a new board. By
default, your board will include three empty lists, like the one shown
in Figure 25.1:</p>
<figure>
<img src="image-19.png" alt="Figure 25.1: Trello Start Page" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 25.1: Trello Start
Page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Though your lists can be modified at any time, this is a great place
to start, and will allow you to create a backlog of stories and tasks
quickly, without regard to importance, how long a task might take to
accomplish, or who will end up implementing them.</p>
<p>Every feature and idea that anyone has is fair game at this stage.
Create a new card in the “To Do” list for every idea, user story, or
task you can think of, as shown in Figure 25.2.</p>
<p>As long as a card is in this list, anyone can make changes to it.
Cards can be moved around at will, but should be sorted by importance.
The more important cards are near the top. This forces you to make value
judgments on the relative importance of your features. Because cards
must be in order, no two cards can share the same significance. This
eliminates the problem of every feature request being considered
“critical.” The most critical card is always the one on top.</p>
<figure>
<img src="image-20.png"
alt="Figure 25.2: Trello board with To Do items" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 25.2: Trello board with To Do
items</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All changes and comments to all cards are logged, so it’s easy to
look back and see a history of how a feature has evolved over time.</p>
<h2 id="estimation">Estimation</h2>
<p>Estimates are important for planning and prioritizing work, even
though they may not be completely accurate. As a project progresses,
teams can use actual data and experience to refine their estimates and
make them more accurate. By tracking progress against estimates, teams
can identify potential issues and adjust their plans accordingly.
Overall, estimates are a valuable tool for managing software development
projects.</p>
<p>Most agile tracking tools have estimation capabilities included, but
Trello has no built-in mechanism for estimating the time any particular
card will take to complete.</p>
<p>There are informal methods for dealing with this, but one
particularly clever idea is to use a web browser extension to make it
painless for the entire team. <a
href="https://scrumfortrello.com/">Scrum for Trello</a> is a free
browser extension for Chrome, Firefox and Safari that will let you place
an estimate on each card’s title.</p>
<p>Once the extension is installed, you can simply click on a card’s
title to set its estimate. A small row of numbers appears just under the
title’s text box. The numbers are the typical agile planning values from
0 to 21. Click on one to set it.</p>
<p>Your development team should go through each card in the To Do list
and assign an estimate. Very simple tasks will probably get a 0.5 or 1.
See Figure 25.3.</p>
<p>Extremely complicated tasks might get a 13 or 21. Those cards should
be broken down into multiple cards so that every estimate is a
single-digit number.</p>
<figure>
<img src="image-21.png"
alt="Figure 25.3: Trello Board with Scrum for Trello Estimates" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 25.3: Trello Board with Scrum for
Trello Estimates</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By design, the numbers do not contain units. They don’t represent any
particular measure of time.</p>
<p>Most Agile practitioners call them story points. For now, don’t get
hung up on what the numbers mean. They won’t be accurate at the
beginning even if you try. The important thing is that the developers
are comfortable that each card has a value that is accurate, relative to
the other cards in the list.</p>
<p>You will notice that the Scrum extension adds up the estimates for
each card and displays the total at the top of the list, as well as the
total of all cards on the board.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-planning-and-scheduling">Iteration Planning and
Scheduling</h2>
<p>Now it is time to start planning and scheduling your actual
development work. You will want to agree with your team on a set period
of time in which your work will be accomplished. Most Agile
methodologies refer to this as an “iteration” or “sprint.” It doesn’t
matter what you call it, and I will use the former term here.</p>
<p>The typical length of an iteration is two weeks, though some teams
like to use one or three. One week iterations can work well for highly
efficient teams doing very small tasks. Three week iterations work well
for some teams, though I find it too long between planning and
feedback.</p>
<p>This is also where you may want to consider making your first custom
list in Trello. I like to create a new list between To Do and Doing.
Simply click the “Add a list…” link to the right of your right-most
list. Call it “Current Iteration.” Create the list and drag it to the
space between To Do and Doing. This is where the current work will
go.</p>
<p>Your task at this point is to select the most important cards from
the To Do list, and move them to the Current Iteration list, as you can
see in Figure 25.4.</p>
<p>Remember that cards should already be organized by importance from
top to bottom, so you simply need to drag them from one list to the
other. As you do so, the Scrum extension will update the list’s
estimate. Continue dragging cards until the developers feel confident
that they can complete the amount of work scheduled.</p>
<figure>
<img src="image-22.png"
alt="Figure 25.4: Trello Board showing work scheduled in the current sprint" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 25.4: Trello Board showing work
scheduled in the current sprint</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Developers should not be pressured to accept more work than they feel
they can handle, especially in your first iteration.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Once your iteration is planned and cards are in the Current Iteration
list, development work can begin. There are now a few rules that must be
strictly enforced during the development phase. One is that no one is
allowed to change any card’s description or estimate. Another is that no
cards be moved between the To Do and Current Iterations lists, with one
exception that I will address shortly. These rules and a few more are
summarized at the end of this post.</p>
<p>At the beginning of every day, the developers should get together to
discuss what cards they intend to work on that day. No two developers
can work on the same card simultaneously. Doing so indicates that there
is more than one task on that card, and it should be split into multiple
cards. You can do that if necessary, but be sure that the total estimate
doesn’t change.</p>
<p>As developers select a card to work on for the day, they will assign
the card to themselves (select the card, click Members, and add
themselves). Then the developer will move the card from Current
Iteration to Doing, and begin to implement the feature on the card, an
example of which can be seen in Figure 25.5.</p>
<p>Throughout development, comments and checklists can be freely added
to the card.</p>
<figure>
<img src="image-23.png"
alt="Figure 25.5: Trello Board showing work in progress" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 25.5: Trello Board showing work in
progress</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The powerful thing about this is that everyone on the team can see
the current state of development at any time at a glance, simply by
loading the project’s board. The boards update automatically when
anything changes, so that all users see others’ changes almost
immediately.</p>
<p>If a developer has a question for someone else on the team, he can
enter that question as a comment on the card, tagging the individual(s)
expected to have the answer. Those tagged in a card will be pro-actively
notified by Trello.</p>
<p>When the developer has finished implementing a particular card, drag
it from Doing to Done. He can then take another card from Current
Iteration, assign himself to it, and drag it to Doing. Developers
continue to work in this way until the iteration ends or they run out of
cards.</p>
<p>Running out of cards is the exception to the rule of not moving cards
between To Do and Current Iteration, as I show in Figure 25.6. This
simply indicates that the developers are working faster than initially
expected. If this happens, management (in consultation with developers)
should move one or more cards from To Do into Current Iteration, again
based on importance. The developers can continue working until the
iteration ends.</p>
<figure>
<img src="image-24.png"
alt="Figure 25.6: Trello Board showing no work left to do" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 25.6: Trello Board showing no work
left to do</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the iteration ends with cards still in the Current Iteration list,
don’t consider it a failure of your estimation or planning. It just
means you put in more cards than the developers were able to finish.
This is important information that you can now use to help plan the next
iteration.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-velocity">Calculating Velocity</h2>
<p>At the end of your iteration, look at the number at the top of the
Done list. This is your “velocity” for this iteration. Whatever that
number is, use it as your number to plan the next iteration. For
example, if the number at the top of Done is 150, then for your next
iteration planning, try to plan cards so that your total estimate does
not exceed 150. This is the reason you shouldn’t concern yourself with
each estimate’s units. If you planned for 120 and the actual is 125,
then your velocity is 125. Plan for 125 next time.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you only achieved 100, then use that for your next
iteration’s plan. It doesn’t matter if the numbers represent hours,
days, or something else entirely. That’s why using an arbitrary term
such as “story points” works so well. No one gets bogged down arguing
over whether a task will take one or two hours.</p>
<p>Track your velocity from iteration to iteration. As each iteration
completes, you will probably find that your planning and estimates get
better. If your numbers vary drastically from iteration to iteration, it
is an indication that something else may be affecting your velocity. A
lower velocity may be a hint that something is hampering your
developers’ effectiveness. A slightly higher velocity could indicate
that your team is starting to get comfortable with the process and with
each other.</p>
<h2 id="individual-velocity">Individual Velocity</h2>
<p>Another metric you can track is velocity by developer. To determine
each developer’s individual velocity, simply add the story points of
each card completed by each developer. This can be of tremendous value
if your developers don’t work the same number of hours each week on your
project.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are using two-week iterations, you have two full-time
developers and one part-time. Plus you have an intern who works whenever
he can. After a few iterations, your two full-time developers have
average individual velocities of 50 and 55. Your part-time developer is
averaging 20. And your intern averages 10. If you also know that your
part-time developer is only working 3 days per week, you can assign him
20/6 or 3 1/3 “points” per day. The intern is working one day per week
on your project, so you assign him 5 points per day. The two full-time
developers also get roughly 5 points per day.</p>
<p>Once you’ve calculated individual velocities, it becomes a trivial
task to see which of your developers is most effective. In my example,
the part-time developer has a lower velocity than the rest. The others
are all about the same.</p>
<p>This being a contrived example, I won’t go into why some developers
will have a higher velocity than others. There are many reasons for
this, and only a few of them have anything to do with one developer
being “better” than others.</p>
<p>Continuing the example, imagine that one of your developers will be
on vacation for half of the next iteration. Knowing his velocity is 5
points per day, you can simply remove 25 points from your next
iteration’s maximum. If the intern gets an extra day next week, you can
schedule another 5 points.</p>
<h2 id="bugs-and-testing">Bugs and Testing</h2>
<p>Your iterations should include cards for testing and bug fixes. Bugs
should be treated no differently than other cards. If bugs are found
during or after an iteration, they need to be added to the To Do list as
individual cards, estimated, and scheduled into the next iteration. If
the bug is truly exceptional and critical to finish in the current
iteration, you may swap the bug fix for an existing card already
scheduled, but not currently being worked on.</p>
<p>It is crucial that you do not add bugs to the Current Iteration
unless you remove enough cards equal to the estimate of the bugs you are
adding.</p>
<p>The overall estimate of the Current Iteration cannot change in the
middle of an iteration. Sometimes you may be tempted to force a higher
velocity on your team by adding more work hours or asking the developers
to work harder, but that tactic will only work in the short-term, and is
likely to backfire on you.</p>
<h2 id="rinse-and-repeat">Rinse and Repeat</h2>
<p>At the end of every iteration, schedule a period of time (an hour or
two) to review the work that was completed. This is the iteration’s
retrospective, where you will calculate and discuss your team’s
velocity. It is a good time to have a “<a
href="https://www.people-results.com/start-stop-continue/">start, stop,
and continue</a>” review to determine what worked and didn’t during the
iteration, and what things can be improved for the next iteration. [Raw
URL: https://www.people-results.com/start-stop-continue/]</p>
<p>Figure 25.7 shows a completed iteration, with nothing left to do.
This is the ideal scenario. That won’t always be the case, though. Any
cards remaining in the Current Iteration can be left there for the next
iteration, or if management decides, can be put back into the To Do list
for reevaluation. The same goes with cards in the Doing list, though
because work has already started, it would be a waste to move them back
into the To Do list.</p>
<p>All cards in the Done list can be archived. Alternatively, you can
rename the Done list with the current iteration number, and then archive
the entire list. If you choose this route, simply create a new Done list
to be used with the next iteration.</p>

<img src="image-25.png"
alt="Figure 25.7: Trello Board showing a completed iteration" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 25.7: Trello Board showing a
completed iteration</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you have completed the retrospective, you can roll right into
the planning for your next iteration, and repeat the process.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Once you’re become accustomed to working in this manner with Trello,
you should find that your planning sessions become more productive,
management will always know the state of the work being done, and
developers will argue less over their estimates and work assigned to
them. Eventually you will reach a state of predictable releases, which
will make everyone happy.</p>
<h3 id="rules-to-live-by">Rules to Live By</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, there are a few rules that everyone needs to
agree to if you want to make this work. Many agile tracking systems can
help enforce these rules. Other than logging all changes, Trello won’t.
It’s up to the team to be professional and agree to stick to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can add a card to the To Do list at any time</li>
<li>Management can change any card in To Do.</li>
<li>Only management can rearrange a card’s priority in the To Do list in
relation to another card.</li>
<li>Only developers can provide or change a card’s estimate, and only if
that card is still in the To Do list.</li>
<li>Once a card is scheduled, it cannot be modified, except by adding
comments and checklists.</li>
<li>Management may not touch cards that are in Current Iteration or
Doing lists. They may comment on them freely, however.</li>
<li>Developers assign themselves to cards during daily planning
meetings. Management should never dictate who implements which
cards.</li>
<li>A developer can only be assigned to one card in the Doing list at a
time.</li>
<li>Only one developer should be assigned to a card. If multiple
developers are assigned, it is a sign that the card is too complex and
should be broken up.</li>
<li>If a developer does not complete a card, it can be put back in the
Current Iteration list to be finished later.</li>
