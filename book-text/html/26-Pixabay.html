<h1 id="pixabay.com-image-repository">Pixabay.com Image Repository</h1>
<p>Where to get Creative-Commons licensed images for almost any purpose.
The other day I was looking for a picture of a swimming pool for a
mobile app I am writing (more on that later). Much to my excitement, I
stumbled upon an online image catalog called Pixabay
(https://pixabay.com).</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Pixabay claims to have over 4,100,000 images that can be used free of
charge. Their terms of service indicate that every image is bound to the
CC0 Public Domain license, which puts them into the public domain, and
thus can be used for any legal purpose.</p>
<p>As of August 2023, Pixabay offers a variety of media types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images: photos, vector graphics, animated GIFs, and
illustrations.</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Music</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, I focus on images, but videos and music work the
same way.</p>
<h2 id="image-search">Image Search</h2>
<p>The site is attractive and easy to use. I typed “swimming pool” into
the search box and was quickly rewarded with more than 2300 images to
review.</p>
<p>When searching for an image, you can choose a single image type or
all. I changed my search to include only photos, which reduced my search
results to just over 2100. Obviously most of their images of swimming
pools are photographs.</p>
<p>There are more search options available. You can search by portrait
or landscape orientation, which Pixabay calls vertical or horizontal.
You can also search by category, dominant color, transparent, or even
black and white images. The end result is that it is easy to find the
right image for your needs.</p>
<p>The search results are conveniently organized into a grid resembling
a light box that most people will find intuitive. The first row of
images are “sponsored” by iStock. I get it. That is how they make their
money. Quite frankly, the free images are of no lesser quality than the
sponsored ones.</p>
<p>Navigating the search results is simple. There are pager controls at
the top and bottom of the grid. It irritates me whenever I see a website
that only has pager controls at the top or bottom. How hard is it to do
both? Further demonstrating their understanding of how most people will
browse the search results, there is a big “Next page” button at the
bottom. As you hover over an image, you can see its tags along with the
number of people who have “liked” or “favorited” the image.</p>
<p>Some images may be identified as “Adult Content.” You cannot see the
image until you click on it and accept the warning. You can turn this
feature off, but I tend to leave it on. Though there are some nudes on
the site, I have yet to see anything I would consider pornographic.
Their opinion of what constitutes adult content errs on the side of
caution. That said, you have been warned.</p>
<h2 id="image-details">Image Details</h2>
<p>Clicking on an image takes you to its detail page, containing the
artist name, how long ago the image was uploaded, how many times it has
been viewed and downloaded, and its license. So far, I have only seen
public domain licenses that are “Free for commercial use / No
attribution required.” Some images include the details of the camera
that took the pictures and its settings (shutter speed, lens focal
length, aperture, etc.) Below the image are thumbnails of similar images
from the site. There is also a small collection of iStock-sponsored
images that I found to be somewhat related to the image selected.</p>
<p>At one time, Pixabay required you to register if you wanted to
download any of their images. That seemed fair, but appears no longer to
be the case. I have been a registered user for about eight years now.
Registration is free and quick. They do not even require any personal
information other than your email address. In the years since I signed
up, they have never sent me a single email or bothered me in any way.
Nor have I suddenly and mysteriously been inundated with ads for the
types of images I have searched for.</p>
<p>Registered or not, you can download an image from its detail page.
Simply select the image size you want. There are usually four options.
Then click the big green Download button. The actual image dimensions
and file sizes are conveniently displayed, so you will be sure you get
the exact image you want.</p>
<h2 id="thank-the-artist">Thank the Artist</h2>
<p>Pixabay appears to be trying to make itself a social network of
media, and it has all of the tools you’d expect to make that happen. You
can “like” images, leave comments, mark an image as a favorite, or share
it on Facebook and Instagram. You can even follow or message a favorite
artist. Intelligent hyperlinks throughout the site let you immediately
find other images by the same artist, taken by the same camera, etc.</p>
<p>One of my favorite features is the Donate button. On an image detail
page is a green button labeled “Donate.” When you download an image, you
are presented again with a similar button. Clicking it will take you to
PayPal.com, where you can contribute any amount you feel appropriate to
the artist. I presume many of their artists use Pixabay as a portfolio,
and as a way to get noticed.</p>
<h2 id="pixabay-for-artists">Pixabay for Artists</h2>
<p>If you are a fledgling artist, or even a seasoned professional,
Pixabay makes it easy for you to upload your own photos. They have a
full page describing their image quality guidelines, along with plenty
of examples of what not to submit. There is even a list of image tags
their users are searching for. If you upload ten or more photos, they
say they will remove all ads. I haven’t tried this yet, but I might.</p>
<p>If you have your own portfolio of images, Pixabay is a great way to
set up an online portfolio.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, Pixabay contains an impressive collection of
high-quality, beautiful and useful images, all free of charge, that can
be used for practically any purpose you can imagine. Not only did I find
the perfect background image I needed, I found an image to use as a
splash screen, and even a mobile application icon. The process was quick
and simple. And it sure beats paying tens or even hundreds of dollars
for a “professional” image.</p>
